### Course 2: Introduction To AWS Compute Services
In this course, you’ll learn how to take your computing power to the cloud! We’ll walk you through several different AWS computing services. Whether you need virtual servers through EC2, a serverless solution with Lambda, or container management through ECS or EKS we’ve got you covered! And if you don’t know which service is right for you, you’ll learn about different use cases for each service. By the end of this course, you’ll know how to create a scalable, secure, and cost-effective computing solution that is perfect for your business use case.

#### Prerequisites:
- An understanding of cloud fundamentals
- Familiarity with the AWS Management Console
	
Justification: In order to implement a solution using EC2, learners should have a basic understanding of what cloud computing is and how to navigate the AWS interface.

#### Learning Objectives:
- Learners will be able to explain the difference between AWS compute services (like EC2, Lambda, ECS, and EKS) and their use cases.
- Learners will be able to create and configure virtual machines using EC2
- Learners will be able to explain how to scale and secure a cost-effective AWS compute solution.

### Course 3: Introduction To AWS Storage Solutions
In this course, you’ll learn how to use Amazon Web Services to keep your data safe and secure in the cloud. We’ll teach you the ins and outs of AWS’s storage services like S3, EBS, and EFS so you know which solution is the right one for your needs. You’ll also get hands-on experience configuring and optimizing these three solutions to store your data as cost-effectively as possible.

#### Prerequisites:
- An understanding of cloud computing fundamentals
- Familiarity with the AWS Management Console
- Familiarity with AWS Compute Solutions

Justification: In order to implement a solution using S3, learners should have a basic understanding of what cloud computing is and how to navigate the AWS interface. Learners should also have a basic understanding of AWS Compute Solutions, as some storage solutions are closely linked to Compute.

#### Learning Objectives:
- Learners will be able to explain the difference between AWS Storage solutions (like S3, EBS, EFS, and FSx) and their use cases.
- Learners will be able to create and optimize a storage solution using S3 and EBS.
- Learners will be able to explain how to secure and optimize storage solutions.

### Course 4: Introduction to AWS Database Solutions
In this course, you’ll learn which of the many AWS database solutions is right for your use case. We’ll teach out the difference between services like RDS, DynamoDB, and Redshift, so you can feel confident in building out your cloud database. You’ll also get hands on experience deploying your first database and learn how to keep it secure, reliable, and cost-effective!

#### Prerequisites:
- An understanding of cloud computing fundamentals
- Familiarity with the AWS Management Console
- Familiarity with relational database basics (basic queries, creating tables, etc)

Justification: In order to implement RDS, learners should have a basic understanding of what cloud computing is and how to navigate the AWS interface. It is also important that learners have a basic understanding of relational databases in order to experiment with some of the features of RDS.

#### Learning Objectives:
- Learners will be able to explain the difference between AWS Database solutions (like RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, and Redshift) and their use cases.
- Learners will be able to create, manage, and optimize a relational database using RDS.
- Learners will be able to explain how to secure and backup cloud database solutions.

### Course 5: Introduction to AWS Networking

In this course, you’ll learn how to create complex cloud networks using AWS services like CloudFront, and Global Accelerator. You’ll dive deep into fundamental networking concepts like subnets, routing, and IP addressing through hands-on practice of creating and deploying your own virtual private cloud. Finally, you’ll learn to configure your network to make it secure and cost-optimized.

#### Prerequisites:
- An understanding of cloud computing fundamentals
- Familiarity with the AWS Management Console, AWS storage services, and AWS Database services

Justification: In order to implement a VPC solution, learners should have a basic understanding of what cloud computing is and how to navigate the AWS interface. It is also important that learners have a basic understanding of AWS storage or database services, as the VPC will integrate those services.

####
- Learners will be able to explain networking services (Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator) and networking architecture concepts (subnets, routing, IP addressing)
- Learners will be able to design and deploy a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and integrate it with storage or database services.
- Learners will be able to apply best practices with respect to network security, performance, and cost.

### Course 6: Prepare For The AWS Solutions Architect Certification Exam

# Course: Introduction to AWS Storage Solutions
In this course, you’ll learn how to use Amazon Web Services to keep your data safe and secure in the cloud. We’ll teach you the ins and outs of AWS’s storage services like S3, EBS, and EFS, so you know which solution is the right one for your needs. You’ll also get hands-on experience configuring and optimizing these three storage solutions to store your data as cost-effectively as possible.
